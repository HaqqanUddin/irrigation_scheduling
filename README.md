# Irrigation Scheduling

This repository contains resources for the postgraduate course CE-577: Irrigation System Design and Management offered at NED University of Engineering and Technology. It includes Python scripts and supporting materials for computational tools used in irrigation planning. The script irrigation_scheduling.py generates daily irrigation schedules based on soil, crop, and climatic data, utilizing crop evapotranspiration (ETc) calculations and soil water balance principles. The script et_calculation.py estimates reference evapotranspiration (ETo) using the Modified Penman Method, incorporating parameters like temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed. Students will learn to design efficient irrigation schedules, calculate water requirements, and integrate theoretical concepts with practical tools for effective water resource management. Detailed documentation and sample datasets are provided to guide implementation, with outputs saved in Excel format for easy interpretation.
